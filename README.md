# Use Docker to Launch CMS Instances

> NOTE: This is a work in progress!

# Overview

This document describes how to build the CMS system into one of two target systems:

* A new **Virtualbox** on your **OSX** computer used for development.
  This is used primarily for development of this script.
* A new **EC2** instance.  This is used primarily for redeploying a new **acceptance**
  (*canonical cukes*) system.
  In the future, it will probably be used for deploying all **EC2** instances: **acceptance**,
  **staging**, AND **production**, but we're not there yet.

The detailed instructions are in this project's wiki section in GitHub.
